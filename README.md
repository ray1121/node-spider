This is a spider by [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)

[winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)for log and write results to a file in dist folder

Maybe you need read the code in `src/spider.js` modify something and to write the configs for yourself,because this project is to get some data for my tech-group
